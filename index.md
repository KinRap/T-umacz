>*Stories are everywhere.
Not only do we tell stories, but stories tell us:
if stories are everywhere, we are also in stories.*

# Introduction

Whether we are dealing with a story told via spoken word or written text, as long as it depicts a sequence of events during which some sort of change occurs, we must be dealing with a narrative. Sometimes, if the events or characters depicted in the story captivate us enough, we return to it again and again. Rarely, however, does anyone among the target audience think to ask what the actual purpose of the story’s creation was. This is one of the questions that the field of narrative analysis strives to answer.

# Communication model

Man is a social being. As such, he has always endeavoured to make contact with others. This contact can still be observed today. Its fundamental form is as follows:

As well as transmitting information, man has also presented various forms of stories. In time, people began to write these stories down, and the communication model shifted towards: 

- author 
- text 
- reader. 

However, for the purposes of the narrative analysis I undertake in this paper, this model needs to be modified. Its basic form, then, is as follows:
```
implied author–narrative–implied reader
```
